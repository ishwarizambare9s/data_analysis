#Uber Drive Data Analytics using Python
This project analyzes Uber drive data using Python to find patterns in trips, peak hours, trip purposes, and ride frequency. The analysis is done using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, with visualizations to understand user behavior and travel trends. The notebook includes data cleaning, preprocessing, EDA, and insights from the dataset.

#Traveling Website (MERN Stack)
This project is a MERN Stack–based travel website where users can browse destinations, view travel packages, and make bookings. The app includes a user panel for exploring travel options and an admin panel for managing destinations, packages, and bookings. It is built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js & Express.js for backend APIs, and MongoDB for data storage.

#Land Classification using CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify different land types such as agricultural, residential, industrial, forest, and barren land using satellite images. The model is trained on image datasets to learn features and predict land categories with improved accuracy.
